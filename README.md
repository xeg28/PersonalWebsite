# Personal Website

I created a personal website using the React framework to showcase some of my best work. This website includes information about myself such as a personal statement, experience, projects, and contact information.

## Features
- Includes a navigation bar that scrolls to the appropriate area of the page.
- The website is responsive for large and small screen sizes.
